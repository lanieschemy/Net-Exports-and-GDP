## Effects on Imports and Exports on GDP
Applied a panel data model to better understand the effects of imports and exports on GDP across time and different countries
## How It's Made
* Data
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset
* Packages
  - plm
  - AER
  - MASS
  - corrplot
  - car
  - ggplot2
  - coefplot
## Key Features
* Descriptive Statistics
  - Boxplots
  - Histograms
  - Scatterplots
  - Correlation plots
* Panel Data Models
  - Pooled Model
  - Fixed Effects
  - Random Effects
* Finding the Best Model
  - Cluster-Robust Standard Errors
  - Plot Means
  - Coefficient Plots
  - pFtest
  - pHtest
## Lesson Learned
The analysis from the pooled model versus the random effects model(found as the best model), are contradacting. This is why doing the work to find the best model is so significant to having accurate results.
